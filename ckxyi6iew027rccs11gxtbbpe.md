## Catch up with me - December 2021

**Happy New Year!!!** ‚ú®

December was a great month for me! Find out why! üòâ

## Microsoft Azure Most Valuable Professional - Microsoft Azure MVP
First, on Wednesday, 1st of December, when I was going to turn my laptop off, after work, I received an email that told me I had been awarded as a Microsoft Azure Most Valuable Professional!

This is so huge for me, as I am a young tech professional. As you can imagine, I felt so excited and happy, because I didn't wait for this to happen in 2021!

You can visit my Microsoft MVP profile [here](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5004643?fullName=Maria-Anastasia%20Moustaka).

I will write another article about how I became a Microsoft MVP, as I have been asked about that many times.

## Blog news

### Azure IoT News
As every month, I have written an article about Azure IoT news for this month.

This month we hadn't so much Azure IoT news, maybe due to holidays, but you can read about this news on my [blog post](https://www.thinkaboutiot.com/index.php/2021/12/10/azure-iot-news-december-2021-by-think-about-iot/) or on my [Hashnode post](https://mariamou7.hashnode.dev/azure-iot-news-december-2021-by-think-about-iot).

## Job news
As you may know, I work at the [Team Candi](https://candi.gr/) of [InfoQuest Technologies](https://www.infoquest.gr/). We had some great moments there, this month! We made a Christmas call with several teams of InfoQuest, and it was so great! Also, we received some Christmas gifts from [You.gr](https://www.you.gr/), and this was a wonderful surprise for me as I work there for only 5 months!

Me before our Christmas call:
