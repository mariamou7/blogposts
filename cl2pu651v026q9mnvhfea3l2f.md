## Azure IoT News â€“ May 2022 by Think About IoT

## Week 1-8/5
ðŸ”¸ Update your **IoT Edge** devices on **Raspberry Pi OS** Stretch.

Because community support for Debian 9 (Stretch) LTS will end on June 30, 2022, Microsoft will no longer release patch updates for IoT Edge on Raspberry Pi OS Stretch devices.

Your IoT Edge device will continue to run, and your applications will not be impacted. Previously published packages for Stretch will continue to be available.

However, after that date, Microsoft will no longer be publishing patch releases of IoT Edge's armhf packages targeting Stretch.
