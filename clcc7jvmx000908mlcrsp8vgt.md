# Maria-Anastasia's 2022 Recap

### January

In January, I reached **2000 followers** on Twitter, and I celebrated with a giveaway.

In that month, I wrote two articles on my blog; “[**Catch up with me – December 2021**](https://www.thinkaboutiot.com/index.php/2022/01/03/catch-up-with-me-december-2021/)” and “[**Azure IoT News – January 2022 by Think About IoT**](https://www.thinkaboutiot.com/index.php/2022/01/05/azure-iot-news-january-2022-by-think-about-iot/)”.

Moreover, my robotics students and I participated in the **Mega Event** of the United Dojo about Astro Pi.

### February

In February, I passed the **Azure AI Fundamentals** exam!

Also, I wrote the “[**Azure IoT News – February 2022 by Think About IoT**](https://www.thinkaboutiot.com/index.php/2022/02/01/azure-iot-news-february-2022-by-think-about-iot/)” and “[**Catch up with me – January 2022**](https://www.thinkaboutiot.com/index.php/2022/02/02/catch-up-with-me-january-2022/)”.

### March

March is a month for women’s equality awareness. For this reason, due to Women’s Day 2022, the Rhodian newspaper [“Rodiaki”](https://www.rodiaki.gr/) published [an article with four successful women in male-dominated professions](https://www.rodiaki.gr/article/473147/epityxhmenes-gynaikes-se-andrika-epaggelmata). So, I had the honour to participate in this interview and share my experiences in the field of technology.

Moreover, I participated in my first **Microsoft MVP Summit**! I gained a lot of knowledge and “met” new MVPs.

Another significant change for me was that the Microsoft MVP program had announced new categories, and I have become an **Internet of Things Microsoft MVP**!

Plus, I reached **3000 followers** on Twitter!!!

Last but not least, I travelled with my family, and we had a great tour around the Peloponnese.

### August
