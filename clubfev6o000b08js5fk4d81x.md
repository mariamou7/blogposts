### **Azure Maps Native SDK for Android and iOS will be retired**

Heads up for developers using Azure Maps Native SDK for Android and iOS! Microsoft is retiring this SDK on March 31st, 2025.

To ensure a smooth transition, they recommend migrating to the Azure Maps Web SDK integrated within a web view.

Don't worry, you can continue using the Native SDK until the deadline. However, after March 31st, 2025, your app's data and functionality will be lost. For a hassle-free migration process, check out the resources provided by Microsoft to guide you through switching to the Web SDK.
