### **Azure Digital Twins Unleashes Bulk Delete Capabilities with Delete Jobs API**

Azure Digital Twins introduces the Delete Jobs API, a powerful tool that enables bulk deletion of entities within a twin graph. This innovative feature eliminates the need for repetitive API calls to individually delete models, twins, and relationships, streamlining the deletion process and minimizing error-handling complexities.

**Streamlined Entity Deletion with Delete Jobs API**

The Delete Jobs API simplifies entity deletion within a twin graph, offering several key benefits:

* **Reduced API Calls:** Instead of making numerous API calls to delete individual entities, the Delete Jobs API allows for bulk deletion with a single request. This significantly reduces the time and effort required for large-scale deletions.
    
* **Simplified Error Handling:** By consolidating deletion operations into a single API call, the Delete Jobs API streamlines error handling. This reduces the overhead associated with managing individual error responses and retries.
    
* **Enhanced Efficiency for Simulations and Environment Refresh:** The Delete Jobs API plays a crucial role in enabling efficient simulation and environment refresh scenarios. By facilitating rapid deletion and repopulation of the entire twin graph, the API simplifies the setup and execution of these use cases.
