## **June**

ðŸ”¸ **Azure Digital Twins** Jobs API for bulk import is now in the GA release.

With this API, large twin graphs can be ingested into Azure Digital Twins with enriched logging and higher throughput, which in turn enables simulation scenarios, faster setup of new instances, and automation of data import workflows into twin graphs.

This eliminates the need for multiple API requests to ingest a large number of entitiesÂ and the need for handling errors and retries across these multiple requests.
