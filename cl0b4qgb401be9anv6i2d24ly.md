ðŸ”¸ **Azure Synapse** Link for **Azure Cosmos DB** partitioning Spark 3.1 is now in public preview.

Partition your Azure Cosmos DB analytical data using keys that are critical for your business logic to achieve better query and data load performance. Partition pruning results in faster analytical queries and loads as fewer data is scanned in the partitioned stores. You can also benefit from the data processing improvements if your workloads have many updates or deletes.

ðŸ”¸ Azure Private Link support in **Azure API Management** is now in public preview.

With this, incoming traffic to Azure API Management's gateway can be secured to clients running in a virtual network through Azure Private Link. This will limit access to Azure API Management by assigning a virtual network private IP address to the Azure API Management gateway using Azure Private Link.

Previously, only Developer and Premium tiers supported this integration with a virtual network. With this update, you can now integrate to clients in a virtual network privately, using the tiers-Developer, Basic, Standard, and Premium.

## Week 21-27/3
ðŸ”¸ Connect and manage devices in **Azure IoT Central** without models.

You can now connect devices, send data, and run commands without having first to create a device model/template, enabling a low friction first-run experience.

Once the devices are cloud-connected, you can progressively build the models to leverage a wide set of out-of-the-box capabilities in Azure IoT Central.

In addition to running commands on devices without models, you can also create relationships between devices without having to first create device templates and attach gateway devices to unassigned leaf devices, enabling you to easily represent device topologies.
