## Social Media
### Twitter
Here are some tweets I want to remember:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Do you like the corner behind me? 🤔<br><br>My studio has started to become nice! 🥰 <a href="https://t.co/Nn3uu3YR3f">pic.twitter.com/Nn3uu3YR3f</a></p>&mdash; Maria-Anastasia Moustaka (@mariamou_7) <a href="https://twitter.com/mariamou_7/status/1490001797775343619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As you can see, my studio/office had some upgrades!

Next, of course, I celebrated International Women In Science Day!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/InternationalWomenInScienceDay?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#InternationalWomenInScienceDay</a>!!!<br><br>Girls, don&#39;t let anyone tell you that you can&#39;t deal with something you love! <br><br>💻🦠🔬💉💊🧬🚀🔭⚙️ 🦾🏗️🧮📈<br><br>You can become whatever you want!!!<br><br>👩‍💻👩‍🔬👩‍⚕️👩‍🚀👷‍♀️👩‍🔧👩‍🏭👩‍🏫👩‍🎓</p>&mdash; Maria-Anastasia Moustaka (@mariamou_7) <a href="https://twitter.com/mariamou_7/status/1492178871633985548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## Job news
In my job at [Team Candi](https://candi.gr/), I went through a series of training.
First, I took a GDPR training and then an Azure AI training. Finally, I participated in a SaaS Microsoft Marketplace Hackathon, in which I gain a lot of knowledge.

On the 25th of February, I pass the Azure AI Fundamentals exam!
