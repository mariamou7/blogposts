## Catch up with me - November 2021

### Azure IoT News
First, this month we had so many Azure IoT news. You can read about all of these and about some news related to Azure IoT on my [blog post](https://www.thinkaboutiot.com/index.php/2021/11/03/azure-iot-news-november-2021-by-think-about-iot/)  or on my [Hashnode post](https://mariamou7.hashnode.dev/azure-iot-news-november-2021-by-think-about-iot).

### Power Platform Developer Associate
Moreover, on 11th of this month, I passed the Power Platform Developer Associate (PL-400) Microsoft certification exam! ü•≥ü•≥

It was a little difficult certification exam, but I am so grateful for all the knowledge I gain!

I am so thankful about [Œ§ŒïŒëŒú CANDI](https://candi.gr/) for the opportunity and the knowledge that gave me!

### Microsoft Tech Days: A flight into IoT
Next, I had the pleasure to be part of the [Microsoft Tech Days: A flight into IoT](https://aka.ms/techdays/iot)!

In this event we took through an end-to-end solution from real flight tracking data like speed, altitude and location from a flight departing London. During the event, we tracked the flight‚Äôs progress to its destination and show how to get that data from an IoT device at the edge into Microsoft Azure IoT and the cloud where it can be processed for display on a dashboard or stored for later processing.

It was my biggest event, and I am so thankful for this experience and all the knowledge I gain! There I presented about Service Bus and Logic Apps.

I want to thank [Pete Gallagher](https://twitter.com/pete_codes) and [Clifford Agius](https://twitter.com/CliffordAgius) for inviting me to speak at this great event!

### Robotics lessons
Last but not least, in the institution I teach robotics and programming to kids and teens, we started learning Python! I'm so proud of these students because they are so smart and kind!
