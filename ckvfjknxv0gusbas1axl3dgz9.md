## Azure IoT News – October 2021 by Think About IoT

## Week 1-3/10
There wasn’t any update for the first week of this month.

## Week 4-10/10
🔸 Azure Sphere version 21.10 is expected on the 20th of October 2021.

Before then, Azure Sphere OS version 21.10 is available for evaluation in the Retail Eval feed. This period provides 2 weeks for backwards compatibility testing.

During this time, you have to verify that your applications and devices operate properly with this release before it is deployed broadly via the Retail feed.

The evaluation release of version 21.10 includes an OS update only. When 21.10 is generally available later in October, an updated SDK will be included.

This retirement affects the management API. Runtime operations such as sending or receiving messages are not affected.

You have to review the migration guide and transition to ARM.
