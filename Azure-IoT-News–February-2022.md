ðŸ”¸ The **Azure Sphere OS** 22.01 release is cancelled.

Azure Sphere OS version 22.01, previously scheduled to release for general availability on Jan 26, is cancelled. The next release of Azure Sphere will be version 22.02.

During the evaluation period for 22.01, an intermittent network connection failure was discovered during the OS update process when using the ENC28J60 Ethernet interface for Internet connectivity. To adhere to Microsoft's quality standards is cancelling the 22.01 release while we investigate this. The Retail Eval feed will continue to deliver version 22.01 until MS publish version 22.02 in approximately three weeks.

The 22.01 evaluation release did not include critical security updates, and this cancellation will not impact the security of Azure Sphere-based products.
