## Happy Women's Day 2022

Happy Women's Day! 🦸‍♀️💪

We must not forget that this day is dedicated to the struggle of women, for equal rights.

We want:
👉 gender equality 
👉 to end gender-based violence 
👉 to achieve equal pay

Moreover, due to this day, the Rhodian newspaper Rodiaki published an article with four successful women in male-dominated professions.

I want to thank Rodiaki and Dimitra Stagka, for asking me to participate and share my experiences in the field of technology.

You can read this article [here](https://www.rodiaki.gr/article/473147/epityxhmenes-gynaikes-se-andrika-epaggelmata).

P.S. It is in Greek, but with the help of a translator, you can read it in any language you wish. 😊
